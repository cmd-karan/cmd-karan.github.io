              I'm Karan, a Senior Undergraduate Student at the Electronics and
              Communiation Engineering Department, at Indian Institute of

            <p>
              I love to write '<span>neat</span>' C++, JS & Python code. So, if
              you want to discuss anything, I will be happy, just drop an
              e-mail. But, don't ask my future plans in there.ðŸ¤¢
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from this, I have spent my past three-years in polishing
              Programming skills and explored a lot in the field of
              Web-Designing and Machine Learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from these professional interests, I am so obsessed with
              talking and having never ending discussions in free time. ðŸ˜‰
